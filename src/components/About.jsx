        "Completing a job right as intented with success" is my motto. I have an
        analytical mindset, which enables me to blend research with my own
        knowledge to produce results or to clarify the paths to the target. I am
        a self-tought frontend web developer. I am keen, hardworking and always
        approaching problems pragmatistic. I am also interested greatly with new
        technologies or tools. I like to meddle with them and could possibly add
        them into my project/future projects.
